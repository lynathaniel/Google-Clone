# Since we did not have three major bugs, we will describe the processes we used to 
# avoid bugs and write working code.

## A) Pair Programming
- For this homework, my partner and I would sit together in person while programming.
  This allowed us to tackle the homework with maximum efficiency, since we would be 
  able to bounce ideas off each other. We would also be able to look at each other's 
  code whenever we got stuck, which made debugging quick. 

## B) Following the Suggested Work Schedule
- By following the suggested work schedule, we were able to think about the homework
  in a way that let us visualize how each component worked together. This was especially
  important for classes like HttpServer and HttpConnection, which served as the basis for 
  serving and receiving responses/requests.
